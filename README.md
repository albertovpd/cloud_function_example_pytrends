# Use Pytrends to schedule requests from a Google Cloud Function and storage it in Google Cloud Storage.

- This is part of a project, shown **as example** to use Google Cloud Function with Pub/Sub and Cloud Scheduler to request info from Pytrends and write it to Google Cloud Storage, through the gcsfs library.

- If you are using Cloud Function it is compulsory to follow the architecture of this folder: everything in the same folder, all outputs pointing to "**../tmp**" (that will be generated by the Cloud Function).

- You must zip the elements of this folder (**not the folder**, the scripts) with **requirements.txt**, **your json credentials** and upload it to GCF.

- Instructions on development at this time (15.04.2020). There will be useful documentation soon.
For any doubts, contact us.


        Something worth telling: Do not blindly embrace raw data from Google Trends. Check out info about it:
        - https://support.google.com/google-ads/thread/8389370?hl=en
        - https://github.com/GeneralMills/pytrends/issues/140

        That means Pytrends is useless? Of course not. We encourage you to develop your own structures to avoid or reduce the Google marvelous noise on data.



The ETL involving this piece of script have been developed by Alex Masip and Alberto Vargas, members of the Data Team of Labelium España.
