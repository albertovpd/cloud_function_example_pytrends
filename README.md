# Use Pytrends to schedule requests from a Google Cloud Function and storage it in Google Cloud Storage.

- This is part of a project, shown **as example** to use Google Cloud Function with Pub/Sub and Cloud Scheduler to request info from Pytrends and write it to Google Cloud Storage, through the gcsfs library.

- If you are using Cloud Function it is compulsory to follow the architecture of this folder: everything in the same folder, all outputs pointing to "**../tmp**" (that will be generated by the Cloud Function).

- You must zip the elements of this folder (**not the folder**, the scripts) with requirements.txt, your json credentials and upload it to GCF.

- Instructions on development at this time (15.04.2020). There will be useful documentation soon.
For any doubts, contact us.
