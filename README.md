# Use Pytrends to schedule requests from a Google Cloud Function and storage it in Google Cloud Storage.

- This is part of a project, shown **as example** to use Google Cloud Function with Pub/Sub and Cloud Scheduler to request info from Pytrends and write it to Google Cloud Storage, through the gcsfs library.

- If you are using Cloud Function it is compulsory to follow the architecture of this folder: everything in the same folder, all outputs pointing to "**../tmp**" (that will be generated by the Cloud Function).

- You must zip the elements of this folder (**not the folder**, the scripts) with **requirements.txt**, **your json credentials** and upload it to GCF.


- Instructions on development at this time (15.04.2020). There will be useful documentation soon.
For any doubts, contact us.


        Something worth telling: Do not blindly embrace raw data from Google Trends. Check info about it, for example, here:
        - https://support.google.com/google-ads/thread/8389370?hl=en
        - https://github.com/GeneralMills/pytrends/issues/140


That means Pytrends is useless? Of course not. It looks like the following: 

- Google trends searches the maximum on the specified period, makes that maximum the 100% of Trend Index and everything else is averaged by that top. If you request information weekly, you will have a point with 100% of Trend Index each week.

- If you request a list of elements, all elements will be averaged by the top one.

- If you request each of your keywords separately, each keyword will be averaged on time by its own top.

        We encourage you to develop your own structures to avoid or reduce the Google marvelous noise on data.
